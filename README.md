# Online Code Editor for Front end Tech-Stack‚ù§
Creating a Online Code Editor for HTML,CSS & JAVSCRIPT with clean and awesome USER INTERFACE.
## OBJECTIVE:

- <b>Learning and practicing web development:</b> Online code editors are a great way to learn web development since they provide an easy way to write, test and debug code without having to install any software on your computer. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developers can create interactive web pages and applications and test them in real-time.

- <b>Collaborative coding:</b> Online code editors can be used for collaborative coding, where multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously. They can share the same code editor and view the changes made by other developers in real-time. This feature is particularly useful for remote teams who are working on the same project but are located in different parts of the world.

- <b>Code sharing:</b> With GitHub Pages, developers can host their code online and share it with others. By hosting the code on GitHub, developers can easily share their code with others, collaborate on projects, and receive feedback on their work. GitHub Pages is a free hosting service offered by GitHub, and it is widely used by developers to host their websites and web applications.

- <b>Rapid prototyping:</b> Online code editors can be used to quickly prototype ideas and test out different design concepts. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developers can create interactive prototypes that can be tested in real-time, without having to spend a lot of time and resources on building a full-scale application.
